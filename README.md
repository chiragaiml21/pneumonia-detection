# pneumonia-detection


PROBLEM STATEMENT:-

Challenge: Can AI fight pneumonia?
Imagine you're a researcher tasked with developing a cutting-edge tool to help doctors diagnose pneumonia, a potentially life-threatening lung infection. The catch? You have limited data on chest X-rays, the key diagnostic tool.
Your mission: Design an AI warrior, a neural network, that can:
•	See through scarcity: Accurately predict pneumonia even with a limited dataset of chest X-rays.
•	Learn from others: Leverage knowledge from pre-trained medical image models through transfer learning.
•	Explain its thinking: Use explainable AI (XAI) methods to shed light on its decision-making process, highlighting the critical regions in the X-ray that contributed to the diagnosis.
Can you create this intelligent tool that empowers doctors and potentially saves lives?
Bonus: Consider how your AI warrior can address potential challenges like bias and fair decision-making, ensuring its benefits reach everyone equally.
